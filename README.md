### Program Switch Funtion
Welcome to this program, which is an interactive console application designed to demonstrate the use of control flow and methods in Java. Upon startup, it presents the user with three options that can be selected by entering a specific letter (A, B, or C) into the console.


### Program Description

* This program has three options, three activities within it
  
* Option A: When the user selects option A, the program guides them through the process of adding two numbers. First, the user is prompted to enter the first number and then the second number. Both numbers are read using the "Scanner" object. These values ​​are passed to the "sumNumbers" method, which performs the sum and returns the result. Finally, the program displays the result of the addition on the console.
  
* Option B: If the user chooses option B, the program asks them to enter text. After receiving the text, it is passed to the "resultstring" method, which simply returns the entered string. The program then displays the entered text in the console, allowing the user to see exactly what they have typed.
  
* Option C: Option C allows the user to calculate the cosine of a number. The program prompts the user to enter a number, which is read and passed to the "cosin" method. This method uses the "Math.cos" function to calculate the cosine of the given number and returns the result. The program then displays the cosine value in the console.
